# Comments start with a # sign, do not use them mid-line.
# Each line must be blank, a comment, or a key definition.

# key definition: <action name> <key1> [<key2> [<key3>]]

# cryptic to find what command does what

# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
menu_parent h Left
menu_child  l Right
menu_down   j Down
menu_up     k Up
menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img j Right space
prev_img k Left BackSpace

# rotate image
# counterclockwise
#orient_3 <  
# clockwise
#orient_1 >  

# and image movement
scroll_up    J C-Up
scroll_down  K C-Down
scroll_left  H C-Left
scroll_right L C-Right

# File deletion
remove     d   Delete
delete   C-d C-Delete

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames f

# zooming
zoom_in z 
zoom_out Z 

# I only hit these accidentaly
save_image
save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
